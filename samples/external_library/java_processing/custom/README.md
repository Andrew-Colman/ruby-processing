Building the custom nn Library
==============================
This is example of java library that you cna build yourself with the included Rakefile.
Ideally you will both have ant and jruby installed (and from that you presumably have a jdk-7+ installed).

If you have done all of that compiling and building jar is dead easy just issue the following command in a console.

`jruby -S rake`

you may also need to set JAVA_HOME to point to your jdk eg

`export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.7.0_51` for linux users
